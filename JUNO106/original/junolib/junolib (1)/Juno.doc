Program Function:  While the JUNO-106 can create great synth sounds, 
and the various sliders are a great help for modifying sounds, editing 
patches can be frustrating since the JUNO does not have any way to 
indicate the instrument settings when you select a new patch.  In 
addition, there is no way to name patches, and saving them to tape is 
tedious and limiting.

        To address these problems, I have developed a helpful, easy to 
use program.  This editor/librarian has several functions:

        - On screen display of patch parameters AND changes you have 
made to them.

        - A graphic display of the ADSR envelope.

        - The ability to save and load patches to disk.

        - Random patch creation.

        - Printing of patch parameters.

	    - Selectable MIDI Channel.
	
	

System Requirements: IBM Compatible PC, EGA or VGA monitor, MPU 401 or
compatible midi interface.


Operation: This program is very easy to use.  To start the program, 
type JUNOLIB.  Be sure your JUNO 106 is correctly connected to the 
MIDI interface.  Also make sure the MIDI Function switch on the 106 is 
set to mode III.  By default, the program transmits on MIDI channel 1.  
Function keys 'F3' and  'F4' decrease and increase the midi transmit 
channel.

	Once the program has started, there are three ways to load patch 
data.  You can send it from the JUNO, load a patch from your disk, or 
generate a random patch.
 	
	- Receiving patch from data from JUNO: In order to receive patch 
data from the JUNO, the program's receive mode must be set to 
'ON'(default).  The F5 key toggles this function on and off.  
Once the receive mode is set to 'ON', patch data will 
automatically be received and displayed by the program each time 
you select a patch on the 106.  The main reason you would want 
to turn the receive mode off is so that you could select a 
different patch without the program receiving new patch data 
(which would wipe out the old data). This is useful if you want 
to transmit a new patch to the JUNO 106 to a different 
instrument number.

	- Loading/Saving from the disk:  You can save and load files to 
your disk with a couple of minor limitations.  First of all the 
program will only save and load programs with the '.jno' 
extension.  You do not need to include this extension when 
saving or loading, the program will append it automatically. If 
you have saved files using a different program, you can rename 
them using the '.jno' extension.  The second limitation is that 
all the files must be in the same directory as the program.  I 
think these are reasonable limitations!  To load a file, select 
'F9'.  To save a file select 'F10'.  The either case the program 
will prompt you for a file name. Again DO NOT include the file 
extension. You can hit the 'F2' key at any time to see a list of 
files in your directory. Hitting any key will then return you 
back to the filename prompt.  Once a file is loaded, the patch 
parameters will be displayed and the file transmitted to your 
JUNO.  If the JUNO wasn't ready, 'F6' will retransmit the file.

	- Random Patch: Hit 'F6' to generate a random patch and send it to 
the JUNO. This patch can then be modified, if necessary, and 
saved to the disk. Please note that since, the parameters are 
purely random, the patch may not actually result in a sound on 
the JUNO.  If that is the case you can either hit 'F6' again to 
create another patch, or edit the existing one.

	- Patch Print: To print the patch parameters, be sure you printer 
is on. Hit the 'F7' key to print the patch name and values.  The 
program assumes the printer is connected to the parallel port.

	
	- 'F1' to exit the program.

	That's about it!!

        This is a freeware program!
