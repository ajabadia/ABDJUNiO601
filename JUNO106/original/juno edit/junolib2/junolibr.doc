Juno-106 Patch Librarian for Windows
------------------------------------

 This is a Windows 3.1 patch editor and librarian for the Roland 
Juno-106 synthesiser.
 
System requirements: Windows 3.1, an installed and working MIDI 
interface, a Juno-106 hooked up for MIDI input and output.

To Install the Juno-106 Librarian

1.  Copy the files from the distribution archive into any directory on 
your PC.

2.  If you don't already have it, get a copy of VBRUN300.DLL and put it 
in your Windows system directory.  It's available for Internet ftp from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu:/pub/pc/win3/util/vbrun300.exe.

2.  Run JUNOLIBR.EXE using Program Manager or File Manager.

3.  Select MIDI... from the Options menu and choose the correct input 
and output devices and MIDI channel for the Juno

4.  Make sure the Function switch on the back of the Juno (next to the 
MIDI in socket) is set to position III

5.  Select bank A, patch 11 on the Juno using the front panel switches 
on the synth

6.  If everything is working the description for patch A11 on the screen 
should change to "Undescribed patch", and the sliders and switches on 
the screen display should change to match the synth. If this doesn't 
happen, see the Troubleshooting section in the help file JUNOLIBR.HLP.

If you have any problems please contact davec@wsti.demon.co.uk. 

Thanks to everyone who sent email with comments and bug reports, I 
appreciate it!
