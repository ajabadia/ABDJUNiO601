J106V1.1 1989 D.T.RUSSELL


	  Thanks for downloading J106 I hope it will be as useful
	for you as it is for me.
	  I wrote this program because I could not stand having to
	guess what a parameters value was instead of being able to have
	a value available for viewing like the owners of newer synths
	have.
	  
	  The program is very straight foreward, all the commands are
	given at the bottom of the main menu.
	  Here are some things you should Know:

	* Your Juno-106 must be on midi ch. 1

	* The switch on the Juno-106 marked "midi function selector"
	  must be set to position 3 to send or recieve patches.When
	  it is in this mode it will send a sysex patch dump each time
	  you change to a different patch from the keyboard, this may
	  cause your midi interface to have several patches backed up
	  waiting to be read. For this reason when you decide to send a
	  patch from the Juno-106 to the computer you may have to push
	  f3 several times before it finally gets to the point where it
	  has emptied the buffer and is ready to recieve a patch.This
	  should be evident because the values will not reset as soon
	  as you press f3 when the buffer is empty.

	* This program was written on an xt clone at 4.77hz using a
	  mono monitor. If your using a mono monitor the screens will
	  be written very fast. If your using a different setup I tried
	  to make this program work for you too, but it will write much
	  slower. Please understand that I have no way of knowing for
	  sure it will work on your system but I tried.

	* I accept no responsibilities for any problems or difficulties
	  that may be caused by this program. There should be no possible
	  way that this program could harm your system but just in case
	  I told you so.

	* As is usually the case this software isnt free its just to
	  be used long enough to determine if you will continue to use
	  it. I ask for no set price send whatever you think is fair
	  but at least $1. 

	* Authors of other software may register themselves by simply
	  sending me a copy of their program(s) and putting me on their
	  registered users list.

	
       Please let me know what you think of this program and any ideas
       you might have for improving it.

					Thanks again
